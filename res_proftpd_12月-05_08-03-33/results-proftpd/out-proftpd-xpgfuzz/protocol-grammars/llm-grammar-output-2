For the FTP protocol, the client request templates typically include commands such as USER, PASS, LIST, RETR, STOR, QUIT, and others. Below are common FTP client request templates using type constraints where appropriate:

1. USER command (specify username):
```
USER: ["USER <<STRING:1-256>>\r\n"]
```

2. PASS command (specify password):
```
PASS: ["PASS <<STRING:1-256>>\r\n"]
```

3. LIST command (list directory contents, optional path):
```
LIST: ["LIST <<PATH>>\r\n"]
```
*Note: The path can be empty or a valid path, so you may consider allowing empty string or a path.*

4. RETR command (retrieve a file):
```
RETR: ["RETR <<PATH>>\r\n"]
```

5. STOR command (store/upload a file):
```
STOR: ["STOR <<PATH>>\r\n"]
```

6. QUIT command (close the session):
```
QUIT: ["QUIT\r\n"]
```

7. CWD command (change working directory):
```
CWD: ["CWD <<PATH>>\r\n"]
```

8. PWD command (print working directory):
```
PWD: ["PWD\r\n"]
```

9. TYPE command (set transfer type, e.g., ASCII or Binary):
```
TYPE: ["TYPE <<ENUM:A,I>>\r\n"]
```
*Where 'A' = ASCII mode, 'I' = Image (binary) mode.*

10. PASV command (enter passive mode):
```
PASV: ["PASV\r\n"]
```

11. PORT command (specify client port for active mode):
```
PORT: ["PORT <<INTEGER:0-255>>,<<INTEGER:0-255>>,<<INTEGER:0-255>>,<<INTEGER:0-255>>,<<INTEGER:0-255>>,<<INTEGER:0-255>>\r\n"]
```
*The PORT command uses 6 comma-separated integers representing the IP address and port.*
